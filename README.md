# Computational Physics Projects

This repository contains computational and data analysis projects demonstrating my programming and analysis skills applied to problems in astrophysics and detector characterization.

## Projects

**BV Photometry**  
Analysis of stellar photometric data in the B and V bands.

**Artificial Signal Analysis**  
Study of simulated signals and their statistical properties.

**Dark Current Median Analysis**  
Investigation of dark current in CCD detectors and its statistical behavior.

**Linearity Response Analysis**  
Analysis of the response linearity of CCD detectors under varying signal levels.

**CCD Characterization Summary**  
Summary of CCD detector properties including calibration, detector response, and noise behavior.

**Vela Pulsar Time Series Analysis**  
Time series analysis of voltage data from observations of the Vela pulsar to study pulsar signal characteristics.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document computational and data analysis work related to astrophysical observations, pulsar data analysis, and detector calibration.
